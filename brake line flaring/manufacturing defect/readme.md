Hi! I'm Having a problem with your Hydraulic brake flaring tool.

First I must say I absolutely love this tool! It's very easy to use and  the  dies are very well designed especially with the magnets in them. The hydraulic mechanism multiplies force and makes it very compact (vs ratcheting "Arm" style tool) and the attachable handle makes it a lot easier to assemble & disassemble and change dies


Now I seem to be having either a manufacturing or design defect or both?

So out of the Box my specific tool was producing lopsided flares.  At first I thought it was my technique was wrong? as I'm new to doing brake lines, did I re-read instructions and watch videos and turned out I was doing it correctly. simple 3 step 3 dies process. But from the very first Flair to the last it has been lopsided and giving me trouble ever since. And they are not seating correctly and leaking hydraulic oil / brake fluid. I've only tried 3/16 & 1/4 NickelCopper & 3/8 Aluminum. but it's the same for all. the 3/16 is the worst, because the smale size makes seating issues way more exaggerated.

There is a little play between the dies and the compression tool cylinder mount. I thought it was that? But it's very minor. it looks machined correctly, and even when I center it and hold it by hand while it's compressing, it still makes these bad flares. So it's not that.

I Did more inspectiton of the tool and found the issue: It's the Die holder Casting. or atleast the machining of it.

The casting Die Holder has arms that are only on one side, they're not thick enough imo, and are asymmetric and are in my opinion not designed correctly. If the "width" of them were extended a little to make them stronger! and cover the entire side. I think this tool would be perfect. As it is: it is creating a Torquing force between the threads & the Die, and my particular model has a slighth bend or bowing along the arms. It seems to be less than 10 degrees, and is hardly noticable. but yes, that is indeed enought, to be a problem, and what's causing the bad unusable flares, imo.

That and or the Thread cutting tool was out of alignment? and it's the Threads that are not squared with the Dies? I'm trying to find a pipe that fits it so I can  measure that. What size are those threads?

In any case all flares coming out are not usable. I consider that unacceptable on a precision too like this. But I think it might just be my unit. and regardless a simple redesign of the casting should fix it entirely.

Option 1: return.
...
Option 2:
I have a shop press and can attempt to heat it and bend it back?

But can you give me more information about it?
what type of aloy is this casting made out of? It's very dense.

Option 3:
Do you have a way to buy spare or replacement parts?

Can you ship me another casting? Just that one part? i'll see if it has the same problem? and then I'd feel safe trying to bend & fix the original one.

Option 4:
I don't want to ship the whole tool back. There's nothing wring with the rest of it. Hydraulics & dies seems fine. But if you want I could do that?
