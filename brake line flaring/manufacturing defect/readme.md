Having a problem with your Hydraulic brake flaring tool.

First I must say I absolutely love this tool! It's very easy to use and  the  dies are very well designed especially with the magnets in them. The hydraulic mechanism is easy to use  and the attachable handle makes it a lot easier



no I seem to be having either a manufacturing or design defect or both?

So how did the Box my specific tool was producing lopsided flares.  At first I thought it was my technique was wrong as I'm new to this oh, did I re-read instructions and watch videos and turned out I was doing it correctly. But  from the very first Flair and all after that has been lopsided and are not seating correctly on the nuts of course I never tell me that stock that's how it was why I was Wired from the factory cancer hi hey okay okay alright so beautiful hey oh my god oh boy I don't live here but or be here yeah where do you need me which one is this your doing I can earn

...
I have a shop press and can attempt to heat it and bend it back?

But can you give me more information about it?
what type of aloy is this casting made out of? It's very dense.

Do you have a way to buy spare or replacement parts?

Can you ship me another one? Just that one part? i'll see if it has the same problem? and bend & fix the original one.
