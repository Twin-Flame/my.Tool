Having a problem with your Hydraulic brake flaring tool.

First I must say I absolutely love this tool! It's very easy to use and  the  dies are very well designed especially with the magnets in them. The hydraulic mechanism is easy to use  and the attachable handle makes it a lot easier



no I seem to be having either a manufacturing or design defect or both?

So how did the Box my specific tool was producing lopsided flares.  At first I thought it was my technique was wrong as I'm new to this oh, did I re-read instructions and watch videos and turned out I was doing it correctly. But from the very first Flair to the last it has been lopsided ever since and are not seating correctly and leaking hydraulic oil / brake fluid.

There is a little play between the dies and the compression tool cylinder mount. I thought it was that? But it's very minor. and even when I center it and hold it by hand, as it's compressing, it still makes these bad flares. So it's not that.

I Did more inspeciton of the tool and found the issue: It's the Casting. or atleast the machining of it.
The casting Die Holder has arms that are only on one side, and are asymmetric and are in my opinion not designed correctly. If the "width of them were extended a little to make them stronger! and cover the entire side. I think this tool would be perfect. As it is: it is creating a Torquing between the threads & the Die, and my particular model has a slighth been along the arms. It seems to be less than 5 degrees, and is hardly noticable. but yes, that is indeed, what's causing the bad flares, imo.

of course I never tell me that stock that's how it was why I was Wired from the factory cancer hi hey okay okay alright so beautiful hey oh my god oh boy I don't live here but or be here yeah where do you need me which one is this your doing I can earn

...
I have a shop press and can attempt to heat it and bend it back?

But can you give me more information about it?
what type of aloy is this casting made out of? It's very dense.

Do you have a way to buy spare or replacement parts?

Can you ship me another one? Just that one part? i'll see if it has the same problem? and bend & fix the original one.
